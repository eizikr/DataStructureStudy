### Binary Tree
The Binary Tree implementation provides a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It supports various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

#### Features
- Insertion and deletion of elements in the binary tree.
- Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal of the tree.
- Searching for an element in the tree.
- Calculation of the height and size of the tree.

#### Usage
To use the Binary Tree implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `binary-tree` directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
4. Execute the compiled binary.

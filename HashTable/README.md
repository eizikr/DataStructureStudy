### Hash Table
The Hash Table implementation provides a data structure that enables efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval. It uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing constant-time access in most cases.

#### Features
- Insertion and retrieval of key-value pairs.
- Efficient collision resolution using separate chaining or open addressing.
- Automatic resizing to maintain a balanced load factor.
- Support for dynamic resizing to accommodate a growing number of elements.

#### Usage
To use the Hash Table implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `hash-table` directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
4. Execute the compiled binary.

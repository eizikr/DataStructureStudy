### Linked List
The Linked List implementation provides a dynamic data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations. It consists of a collection of nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node in the list.

#### Features
- Insertion of elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.
- Deletion of elements from the list.
- Searching for an element in the list.
- Traversal operations such as printing the list in forward or reverse order.

#### Usage
To use the Linked List implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `linked-list` directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
4. Execute the compiled binary.

For more detailed information on how to use the Linked List implementation, please refer to the [linked-list/README.md](./linked-list/README.md) file.

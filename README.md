# Data Structures in C

This repository contains four different data structure implementations in C: Linked List, Hash Table, Binary Tree, and Binary Search Tree. These projects were developed as part of my Data Structures course during my software engineering studies.

## Linked List
The Linked List implementation provides a dynamic data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations. It consists of a collection of nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node in the list.

[More about Linked List](./LinkedList/README.md)

## Hash Table
The Hash Table implementation provides a data structure that enables efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval. It uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing constant-time access in most cases.

## Binary Tree
The Binary Tree implementation provides a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It supports various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

[More about Binary Tree](./binary-tree/README.md)

## Binary Search Tree
The Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation is a specialized version of the binary tree where the left child of a node contains a smaller value, and the right child contains a larger value. It enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

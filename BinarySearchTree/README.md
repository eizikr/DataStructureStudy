### Binary Search Tree
The Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation is a specialized version of the binary tree where the left child of a node contains a smaller value, and the right child contains a larger value. It enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

#### Features
- Insertion of elements in a sorted manner.
- Searching for a specific element in the BST.
- Deletion of elements from the BST.
- In-order traversal of the BST.

#### Usage
To use the Binary Search Tree implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `binary-search-tree` directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
4. Execute the compiled binary.
